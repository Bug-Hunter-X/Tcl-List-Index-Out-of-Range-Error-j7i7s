This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl when working with lists: accessing elements using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.tcl` file contains a function that attempts to access a list element.  If the provided index is outside the valid range (0 to [llength $list]-1), it returns an error. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a more robust solution.
